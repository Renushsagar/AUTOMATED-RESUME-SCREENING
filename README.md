**Objective:** The goal was to streamline the recruitment process by automating the screening and ranking of resumes based on job requirements.

**Methodology:** Leveraging machine learning algorithms such as KNeighborsClassifier and OneVsRestClassifier, we developed a robust model trained on a dataset of resumes and job descriptions. Using TF-IDF vectorization for text processing, we achieved remarkable accuracy of 98%.

ðŸ’¡**Key Achievements:**
Implemented a scalable solution to handle large volumes of resumes efficiently.
Improved accuracy and efficiency compared to manual screening methods.
Reduced recruitment time and costs, leading to enhanced productivity and resource allocation.

ðŸ“ˆ **Results:** The automated system accurately categorizes resumes, enabling recruiters to focus on qualified candidates and make data-driven hiring decisions faster.

ðŸŒŸ **Impact:** By automating tedious and time-consuming tasks, we empower HR teams to prioritize strategic initiatives, enhance candidate experience, and drive organizational growth.
